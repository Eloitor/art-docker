# art-docker

Docker image for Arturo

----

Want to run Arturo's REPL with a single command? There is a Docker image for that.

Just open the terminal and type:

`docker run -ti fingidor/arturo-repl`

or (in case there is any error)

`docker run -ti index.docker.io/fingidor/arturo-repl:latest`

That was it. Rock on! ;)
